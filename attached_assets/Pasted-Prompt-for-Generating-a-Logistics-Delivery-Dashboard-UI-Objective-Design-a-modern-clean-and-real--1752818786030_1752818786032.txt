Prompt for Generating a Logistics Delivery Dashboard UI
Objective: Design a modern, clean, and real-time dashboard UI for managing a fleet of delivery agents. The interface should provide at-a-glance information through a map and a detailed side panel, with clear status indicators and filtering capabilities.

1. Overall Layout & Structure
Type: Full-screen web application dashboard.

Main Components:

A persistent Header at the top.

A main content area divided into two vertical sections:

A Collapsible Side Panel on the left (approx. 380px wide).

A Main Map View on the right, occupying the remaining space.

2. Header Component
The header is a clean, single-row element with three distinct sections:

Left Section (Branding & Title):

Display the "TopServe Ltd" company logo.

Next to the logo, show the application title: "Delivery Operations" in a large, bold font.

Center Section (Agent Filter):

A three-segment button group for filtering agents.

Buttons are labeled: "All Agents", "On Delivery", and "Available".

The active filter should have a distinct style (e.g., white background, blue text, subtle shadow). Inactive buttons should have a muted style (e.g., gray background, gray text).

Right Section (Status Indicator):

A "Live" status indicator.

This consists of a small, pulsing green circle followed by the word "Live" in green text.

3. Collapsible Side Panel
This panel lists the agents currently displayed on the map.

Functionality: The entire panel must be collapsible.

When expanded, it should show a "Collapse" icon (a left-pointing chevron/caret) in its top-right corner.

When collapsed, the panel should have zero width, and an "Expand" icon (a right-pointing chevron/caret) should appear on the left edge of the map view.

Content:

Header: A title reading "Agents in View".

List: A vertically scrollable list of "Agent Cards".

4. Agent Card Component (for Side Panel)
Each card represents one agent and summarizes their status.

Style: A rectangular card with rounded corners, a light background (white), and a subtle shadow.

Structure:

Top Row:

Left: The agent's full name in a bold, medium font (e.g., "Maryanne Akinyi").

Right: A status "pill" or "badge" with rounded corners.

If "On Delivery": Light blue background with blue text. It should display the number of stops (e.g., "3 Stops").

If "Available": Light green background with green text. It should display "Available".

Bottom Row:

A short description in a smaller, muted font.

If "On Delivery": Display the total number of packages (e.g., "5 Total Packages").

If "Available": Display the text "Ready for assignment".

5. Main Map View
This is the primary component of the dashboard.

Content: A map interface (e.g., OpenStreetMap style) centered on Nairobi.

Controls: Standard map zoom in/out controls in the bottom-right corner.

Markers: The map is populated with custom markers representing each agent.

6. Map Marker & Popup Components
Marker Style:

Circular icons with a prominent white border and a drop shadow.

If "On Delivery": A blue circle containing a white number that indicates the total number of stops.

If "Available": A green circle containing a white "user" or "person" icon.

Popup Style (on click):

A clean, modern popup with rounded corners that appears when a marker is clicked.

Popup for "On Delivery" Agent:

Agent Name: Large, bold font at the top.

Summary: A line of text below the name showing [X] Stops â€¢ [Y] Total Packages.

Separator: A thin horizontal line.

Invoice List: A list of all deliveries. Each list item contains:

Left side: Invoice Number (bold) on top, Customer Name below it.

Right side: A "Track It" link in blue text.

Popup for "Available" Agent:

Agent Name: Large, bold font at the top.

Status Text: A line below reading "Available for new tasks" in a bold, green font.

7. Key Interactions
Filtering: Clicking a filter in the header (e.g., "Available") instantly updates both the side panel list and the markers on the map to show only the relevant agents.

List-to-Map Sync:

Clicking an Agent Card in the side panel should cause the map to pan and zoom to that agent's marker and automatically open its popup.

Hovering the mouse over an Agent Card should add a visual highlight (e.g., a glowing ring) to the corresponding marker on the map.

Map-to-List Sync (Optional but preferred): As the user pans and zooms the map, the "Agents in View" list in the side panel should update to show only the agents currently visible within the map's boundaries.
